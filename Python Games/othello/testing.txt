Which functions you tested for Part 1
A summary of valid inputs (inputs for which you’d expect a ‘good’ result) and expected return values
A summary of invalid inputs (inputs for which you’d expect a ‘bad’ result) and expected return values
Whether you’re confident you’ve verified every possible eventuality
Whether your testing revealed any bugs that you then went back and fixed.

for Part 1:
- In its current state, each constructor should be tested for each class 
GAME_CONTROLLER:
    No methods that return anything, only changing global variables or displaying
BOARD:
    Only method that returns something is when it checks for a full board because
        it passes this argument to the game controller
TILE:
    No methods that return anything, only changing global variables or displaying
DOT:
    No methods that return anything, only changing global variables or displaying

The main bug that I have added a fix for was when a tile already contained a dot and that Tile
was pressed. Now a print message will be displayed, but the same player will be able to place a dot

Eventual bug testing will pick up with the implementation of more rules... It will involve
trying to figure out what will "break" the code. I can see this being particularly relevant in how lists
are navigated.
