1. I attempted to make my computer a competitive opponent. My AI operates by looking at 
every legal tile on the gameboard and selecting the one that will generate the most number
of flips. In other words, the AI will always be getting maximum flip value with each turn.

2. I was able to do this, and the computer is rather challenging to defeat. I anticipate that if
someone were to "crack the code" they could come up with a strategy to defeat the AI consitently. 

3. Once the human player places a piece, the computer will place the "best" piece based on 
number of flips. The turn will then switch back to the human player. At any point, if a player
is unable to make a move, the player will switch. If this switch occurs for both players, 
meaning neither player is able to spot a legal move, the game will end. 

4. The computer program beat me a majority of the time, although, when I was trying to beat
it, I was able to win a couple of times. I did have a classmate win on their first try which
was impressive.

5. I would improve the AI by finding a way to value placing a piece on the edges, and especially
the corners. If a placement would allow the opponent to place on the corner, you want to avoid that.
