# Welcome to my collection of personal projects!
## I refer to this repo as my arcade suite.
There are currently over 10 playable games that contain many different features such as optimized AI opponents, score keeping, toggleable difficulties, and the ability to create your own game board. There is, of course, room for improvement on many of the games, but that is part of the fun! Enjoy :)
